# SQL Daily Practice with Grow Data Skills

This repository documents my daily progress and solutions for SQL assignments as part of the **Grow Data Skills** course. The focus is on consistency and learning SQL concepts thoroughly rather than rushing to complete assignments. Solutions are written in **MySQL** and updated regularly.

## üìÇ **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized based on the course modules and classes:

- **Module 1 - SQL**  
  - **Class 1**: Foundational SQL concepts (e.g., Database Basics, DDL/DML commands).  
    - `assignments.sql`: Contains solutions to the provided assignments.  
  - **Class 2**: Intermediate SQL (e.g., SELECT queries, Conditional Operators).  
    - `assignments.sql`: Updated with solutions daily.  
  - **Class 3**: Advanced SQL (e.g., Group By, Subqueries, Joins).  
    - `assignments.sql`: Work in progress.  
  - **Class 4**: Expert-level SQL (e.g., Window Functions, Recursive CTEs).  
    - `assignments.sql`: Solutions to assignments will be added progressively.  

Additional resources like `challenges.pdf` (if any) are included within each class folder.
